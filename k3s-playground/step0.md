## Pre-Installation

We want to check the computer resources before installing k3s so that we can compare them to the resources used after installing a single-node K3s cluster.

Inspect the current disk and memory usage (before the installation of K3s):

```
df -h
```{{exec}}


Inspect the memory usage (before the installation of K3s):
```
free -h
```{{exec}}
