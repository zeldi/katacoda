## Fundamental K3s -- Lightweight Kubernetes
In this lab, you will learn how to setup a Kubernetes cluster using K3s.

For both developers and operations teams, an invaluable time-saving approach is the utilization of standardized techniques and tools across various Kubernetes deployments. Typically, Kubernetes installations are geared towards extensive sets of generic virtual machines within commercial cloud services. Additionally, a vibrant community of IoT and edge computing professionals is aiming to implement Kubernetes on diverse and resource-constrained hardware.

Rancher has introduced K3s, a specific variant of Kubernetes meticulously crafted for lightweight performance on hardware with limited resources and minimal services. It offers simple installation, swift configuration, and operates with a small memory footprint, all within a binary file that is under 55 megabytes in size."

In this lab, you will learn how to:

- [x] Install K3s on Linux
- [x] Use K3s just like other Kubernetes clusters
- [x] Access a Kubernetes Dashboard
- [x] Add worker nodes to a K3s cluster

K3s is a certified Kubernetes distribution and a Cloud Native Computing Foundation sandbox project.
